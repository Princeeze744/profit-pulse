    "description": "Case: Sihuan Huashi Enterprises Corporation East Africa Ltd v Landmark Real Estate Investment Trust Ltd (Civil Suit 381 of 2015) [2022] KEHC 14646\n\nCourt: High Court of Kenya at Nairobi (Milimani Commercial Courts ‚Äî Commercial & Tax Division) \nKenya Law\n+1\n\nJudge: E. C. Mwita, J \nSheriaHub\n+1\n\nDate Delivered: 28 October 2022 \nKenya Law\n+1\n\nParties:\n\nApplicant: Sihuan Huashi Enterprises Corporation East Africa Ltd \nKenya Law\n+1\n\nRespondent: Landmark Real Estate Investment Trust Ltd \nKenya Law\n+1\n\nFacts\n\nIn 2015, the court ordered the respondent (Landmark) to deposit the sum of Ksh 15,081,493 into a joint interest-earning bank account (with lawyers‚Äô names) pending resolution of a dispute. \nSheriaHub\n+1\n\nThe deposit was first with Standard Chartered Bank, then varied to be with CFC Stanbic Bank by consent. \nSheriaHub\n+1\n\nThe suit was eventually determined in favour of Sihuan on 5 October 2021 ‚Äî the court declared that Landmark was not entitled to the disputed amount and was barred from calling for its release. \nSheriaHub\n+1\n\nAfter that judgment, Sihuan applied (on 16 November 2021) for release of the funds held in the joint account (plus interest). Landmark resisted, arguing that they had filed a notice of appeal, and that the funds were needed to preserve status quo pending that appeal. \nSheriaHub\n+1\n\nOutcome / Ruling\n\nOn 28 October 2022, the High Court ruled in favour of Sihuan, allowing their motion to release the funds (including interest) which had been held in the joint fixed deposit account. \nKenya Law\n+1\n\nThe Court held that once the suit was finally determined in Sihuan‚Äôs favour, there was no legal basis for the continued holding of the money pending appeal; the original order to deposit the money was to protect it until determination of the suit, not beyond that into appeal. \nSheriaHub\n+1\n\nPossible Relief / Outcome Sought\n\nFrom Sihuan‚Äôs perspective, they sought:\n\nThe release of the funds (Ksh 15,081,493 + interest) held in the joint interest-earning bank account. \nKenya Law\n+1\n\nCosts of the motion. \nKenya Law\n\nLandmark had opposed release based on their appeal, but the court rejected that argument",

    "description": "Case: Kithome & another v Haile & another (Land Case E194 of 2024) [2025] KEELC 4617 (KLR)\n\nCourt: Environment & Land Court of Kenya \nKenya Law\n\nCitation: [2025] KEELC 4617 (KLR) \nKenya Law\n\nJudgment Date: 20 June 2025 \nKenya Law\n\nParties:\n\nPlaintiffs: First plaintiff = Kithome; second plaintiff = another person/entity (unnamed in summary) \nKenya Law\n\nDefendants: First defendant = Haile; second defendant = another person/entity \nKenya Law\n\nFacts\n\nThe plaintiffs claim that on 12 April 2024 they were locked out of the premises by the defendants, constituting a constructive eviction. \nKenya Law\n\nBefore then, on 15 April 2024, the first defendant served a notice of forfeiture purportedly under a tenancy agreement. However, the plaintiffs assert this notice was served after they had already been locked out and so was invalid. \nKenya Law\n\nThe plaintiffs had invested Kshs 1,547,316 in renovations/fits and had business loss of Kshs 24,212,160 over the tenancy period as a result of the eviction & loss of possession. \nKenya Law\n\nLegal Issues / Points in Dispute\n\nWhether the eviction was illegal and/or constructive (i.e. even if there was no formal eviction order, locking out constitutes eviction). \nKenya Law\n\nWhether the notice of forfeiture was lawful, especially given timeline (after eviction) and compliance with the tenancy agreement and legal procedure. \nKenya Law\n\nWhether the plaintiffs should be compensated for their losses: renovations, business loss, loss of personal property. \nKenya Law\n\nOutcome / Judgment\n\nThe case was decided in favour of the plaintiffs in part. \nKenya Law\n\nThe court found that a constructive eviction had occurred. \nKenya Law\n\nThe notice of forfeiture by the first defendant was treated as having no legal effect to justify the eviction after they had already been locked out. \nKenya Law\n\nThe plaintiffs‚Äô claim for business loss, renovations, etc., were considered but the court noted issues in proof (e.g. missing witness for accountant) and some claims were not fully supported. \nKenya Law\n\nReliefs /What was Sought & What Was Awarded\n\nWhat plaintiffs sought:\n\nDeclaration that eviction was illegal & that there was wrongful forfeiture. \nKenya Law\n\nCompensation for renovations & fit-out (Kshs 1,547,316). \nKenya Law\n\nCompensation for loss of business (Kshs 24,212,160). \nKenya Law\n\nCompensation for loss of personal belongings (valued at ~Kshs 1,030,000). \nKenya Law\n\nWhat court awarded / decided:\n\nThe court allowed the claim of constructive and illegal eviction in favour of the plaintiffs. \nKenya Law\n\nOn compensation, some claims were allowed, others reduced or not fully accepted due to proof issues. (E.g. business loss claim had issues because accountant witness was not called). \nKenya Law",
